//! Class for evaluating the Gaussian pair potential
/*! <b>General Overview</b>

    See EvaluatorPairLJ

    <b>Gauss specifics</b>

    EvaluatorPairShiftedGauss evaluates the function:
    \f[ V_{\mathrm{gauss}}(r) = \varepsilon \exp \left[ -\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{r - r_0}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right] \f]

    The Gaussian potential does not need diameter or charge. Two parameters are specified and stored in a Scalar2.
    \a epsilon is placed in \a params.x and \a sigma is in \a params.y.

    These are related to the standard lj parameters sigma and epsilon by:
    - \a epsilon = \f$ \varepsilon \f$
    - \a sigma = \f$ \sigma \f$
